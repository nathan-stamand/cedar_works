# Cedar Works Deck Builders

If you're looking at this project, you probably already know to do this.

But, just in case you tried opening the index.html file and are looking at a garbage page
wondering why I would submit it...

To view properly: 

1.) Clone repository

2.) From cedar_works file, run npm install.

3.) When finished installing, run npm start to run Gulp.

Thanks for checking this out! It's my first time using Foundation and Sass (the little bit I did use), 
so I hope it turned out okay!
